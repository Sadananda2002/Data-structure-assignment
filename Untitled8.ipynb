        "     *String Slicing in Python:\n",
        "      String slicing is a technique in Python to extract a part of a string (substring) by specifying a range of indices. The general syntax is string[start:stop:step],\n",
        "      where: - *start*: The starting index of the slice (inclusive).\n",
        "              - *stop*: The ending index (exclusive).\n",
        "              - *step*: The increment (optional). By default, it's 1.\n",
        "\n",
        "      Examples:\n",
        "      python\n",
        "      text = \"Hello, World!\"\n",
        "      print(text[0:5])   # Output: 'Hello'\n",
        "      print(text[:5])    # Output: 'Hello' (start index is optional)\n",
        "      print(text[7:])    # Output: 'World!' (stop index is optional)\n",
        "      print(text[::2])   # Output: 'Hlo ol!' (step of 2)\n",
        "      print(text[::-1])  # Output: '!dlroW ,olleH' (reversed string)\n",

        "     Python interpreter is not able to generate a hash for the key given in the dictionary, whose data type is a list.\n",
        "     As per the design implementation of Python dictionary, Python dictionaries are saved in the memory using hash tables.\n",
        "     And In most versions of hash tables, there is no way of changing the key of an entry. This is because the key's hash value is very important, changing the key almost always changes\n",
        "     the hash value.If the key were a mutable object, its value could change, and thus its hash could also change\n",
        "     When you try to look up the same object in the dictionary it won’t be found because its hash value is different.\n",
        "     If you tried to look up the old value it wouldn’t be found either, because the value of the object found in that hash bin would be different.\n",
        "     So this is the reason for which dictionary keys must be in immutable form.\n",
